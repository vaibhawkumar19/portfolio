        <p>

          the forthcoming motivate humans to try to predict it, may it be in the
          context of human existence or technology. Talking about technology,
          programming languages have become vital to it in the 21st-century.
          Weâ€™ve all sorts of programming languages capable of accomplishing a
          diverse range of tasks. JavaScript is one of the leading programming
          languages. In fact, it is called the programming language of the web.
          JS is a part of the ever-increasing number of programming options,
          many of which are, in actual fact, inspired from it. The advent of
          Node.js enabled JS to extend its reaches to the server-side. It became
          much easier for organizations to come in contact with full-stack
          developers that can work on both the frontend and backend using
          JavaScript. Hence, there is no need for cross-checking the fact that
          JS is among the best programming languages to start learning in 2022.
